🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/My_Deep_Learning_Works.git
cd My_Deep_Learning_Works
(Optional) Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Jupyter:
jupyter notebook
📌 Notes
Some notebooks use local paths for datasets. Update those paths accordingly.
Pretrained models (like VGG16) may require internet access for weight downloads.
